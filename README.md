This project uses the k-Means clustering to classify 200 households based on their average hourly electricity consumption in the year 2010. The households were randomly selected among the ones available in the 2010 RECS data set for the Midwest region of the United States. The data is in form of a power consumed in Watts(W) by each of the 200 households with a resolution of 10 minutes. 

The process includes:

1.Downloading Data File

2.Data Cleaning and Analysis

3.Data Processing

4.K-Means Clustering



APPLICATION

Clustering of households based on their electricity consumption trends would help utilities identify which houses would prove to be responsive to such price variations and which houses won't. It is observed that households with peak electricity consumption in evening and morning are more responsive to demand response initiatives, compared to household that already have a nearly constant consumption throughout the afternoon and evening. Clustering is the easiest way to segregate households in such groups, thus helping utility companies decide the electricity prices to be kept during different time of the day, such that there is significant energy and monetary savings, with minimal increase in prices.
